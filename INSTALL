=====================================================
1    INSTALLING MYSQL
=====================================================

Log in to your mysql as root and execute:

CREATE DATABASE djmail;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON djmail.* TO djmail@localhost;

If you want to set password for user djmail, you must specify it in following files:

settings.py (DATABASE_PASSWORD)
/etc/exim/exim.conf (mysql_servers)
/etc/courier/authlib/authpgsqlrc (MYSQL_PASSWORD)

Also it works fine with postgresql too. (Of course with some changes in configuration 
files, and sql queries in exim.conf)


=====================================================
2    INSTALLING DJANGO
=====================================================

http://www.djangoproject.com/download/


=====================================================
3    INSTALLING DJMAIL
=====================================================

Just copy 'webmail' directory in location you want to live it, cd to it, and run 
'./manage.py syncdb'


=====================================================
4    INSTALLING EXIM
=====================================================

Sample configuration file can be found in config_files directory. Just change 
primary_hostname, relay_from_hosts, and mysql_servers if you wish.


=====================================================
5    INSTALLING COURIER-IMAP
=====================================================

Make sure that /etc/courier/authlib/authdaemonrc has following line:

authmodulelist="authmysql "

Contents of /etc/courier/authlib/authmysqlrc can be found in config_files directory.


=====================================================
6   RUNNING
=====================================================

Now you can su into user 'mail' and run './manage.py runserver'. Then put your browser 
to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and log in as superuser which you create on step 3.
As you can see, here you can create domains, users, routes and aliases.


=====================================================
7   NGINX
=====================================================

Nginx configuration can be found in config_files directory.
You must change only 'alias' setting in section 'location /amedia/'

>>> import django
>>> django
<module 'django' from '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/__init__.pyc'>
>>> 

As you can see django installed in /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/ so
I need to append contrib/admin/media/ and now I have
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
In your system paths may be different.
