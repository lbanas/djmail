    INSTALLING MYSQL

Log in to your mysql as root and execute:

CREATE DATABASE djmail;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON djmail.* TO djmail@localhost;

If you want to set password for user djmail, you must specify it in following files:

settings.py (DATABASE_PASSWORD)
/etc/exim/exim.conf (mysql_servers)
/etc/courier/authlib/authpgsqlrc (MYSQL_PASSWORD)

Also it works fine with postgresql too. (Of course with some changes in configuration 
files, and sql queries in exim.conf)
